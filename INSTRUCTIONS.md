# Instructions for actions in circoweb-ssh

- When a user asks to perform a task, execute it end-to-end if feasible and safe.
- Do not overburden with copy-paste steps unless necessary for safety or reproducibility.
- Provide a single, ready-to-run command block when possible; otherwise, describe the steps succinctly.
- If user-specified preferences exist (e.g., SSH vs HTTPS, branch name), honor them.
- Confirm outcomes and next steps after completing a task.
