# Circoweb — Local Dev Guide

This repository includes a minimal static website starter and a small local dev workflow.

Getting started
- Prerequisites: SSH access to GitHub, Node.js installed (for npm scripts), and network access.
- The repo includes a ready-to-run local server script via npm:
  - npm install
  - npm start
  - Open http://localhost:8080

What this starter includes
- index.html: Home page
- about.html: About page
- assets/css/styles.css: Basic styles
- assets/js/scripts.js: Tiny JS placeholder

How to test
- After starting the local server, visit http://localhost:8080 to see the site.
- You can modify files in circoweb-ssh and re-run the server as needed.

Next steps (optional)
- Add more pages, a favicon, or a small static site generator.
